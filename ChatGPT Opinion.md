Programmable quantum computers are quantum systems that can be configured or "programmed" to perform various computations across different types of algorithms. These devices use **quantum bits** (or **qubits**), which can represent and process information in ways that classical bits (0 or 1) cannot, due to **quantum superposition** and **entanglement** properties. Unlike classical computers, quantum computers perform operations using quantum gates on qubits, allowing them to solve certain complex problems more efficiently.

Here's an overview of programmable quantum computers:

### Key Concepts in Programmable Quantum Computing
1. **Qubits**: The quantum analog of classical bits. Qubits can exist in a state of 0, 1, or both simultaneously due to **superposition**.
